# Wintrest: Networking during a Pandemic

### Creators: Julie Lely, Shreya Kochar, Melissa Guzman, Silvia Zeamer

Our project is a social media platform for Wellesley students and alumni to network. It is a mixture of Tinder and Linkedin, where users are matched on the basis of what’s important to them - interests, values, personalities, and demographic traits like being first gen, low income, or of a minority ethnic group. Our aim is to create a way for the Wellesley community to create and maintain meaningful relationships in order to intentionally overcome the isolation produced by digital-first communication and continue to provide valuable connections across existing groups going into the future.

On a global level, the coronavirus pandemic has rendered many of the ways we have been accustomed to finding and developing relationships impossible. Isolation has always been a problem at Wellesley because of the heavily academic culture and the difficulty of scheduling time with friends. For many students coming from underrepresented backgrounds, the ins and outs of networking and building relationships with the community of alumni are bewildering and difficult to navigate. Due to the pandemic, there is a pressing need for alternative methods of organic social interaction and the building of effective support networks for students. 

**Our project is potentially a solution to these problems**. It enables students to rebuild some of the sense of community that has been lost. It enables freshmen to form communities amongst themselves and with upperclassmen, from whom they are largely separated in Wellesley’s physical space. It enables connection to alumni mentors, helping students to develop their networks and learn about what life after Wellesley could look like, and providing alumni with a fulfilling way to stay connected to the school.

# Files Explained
## Queries Files
  
### profileQueries.py
The basic backend for the user profile is in this file. Contains the following queries:
* find_profile: Returns the info associated with a given wemail
* find_dem: Returns a user's demographic information; singular row returned
* find_phoneNum: Returns a user's phone number
* insert_profile: Takes new user's initial inputs and adds them into the table
* update_profile: Takes user's changed inputs for their profile and updates the profile accordingly
* delete_profile: Deletes a user profile given their ID

### scoreQueries.py
The algorithm behind matching. Uses a scoring to implement a sorting algorithm to rank matches from best to worst.
* matchScore: Gives a match score between two given users by comparing their various attributes and testing for similarities. Score generated by this is the amount of similar traits two people have.
* matchScore_LLs: Helper function; because each user has multiple love language rows, helper function required.
* matchScore_favorites: Helper function; because each user has multiple favorites rows, helper function required.

### userInfoQueries.py
* find_profInt: Returns a user's professional interest information; singular row returned
* find_favorites: Returns a user's favorites things and their respective genres; will be multiple rows
* find_person_LLs: Returns all of user's love languages; 3 rows returned
* find_MB_info: Takes a user's MBCode and uses it to generate their personality information and role in society as per the Myers-Briggs test.
* getBio: Returns a user's bio
* insert_professionalInterests: Takes user's initial inputs for their professional interests and inserts them into the table. Can have one input per professional interest column.
* update_professionalInterests: Takes user's changed inputs for their professional interests and updates them.
* insert_favorites: Takes user's inputs for their favorite things and their respective genres.
* update_favorites: Takes user's changed inputs for their favorite genres and updates them. Assumes 1 to 1 ratio between itemType and favorite thing
* insert_top3_LL: Takes user's inputs for a love language and inserts it into the table. We assume that the user inputs their top 3 languages (all of equal weight). Only occurs if the user is filling these out for the first time. Must be called thrice, once for each language.
* update_top3_lang: Takes user's changed inputs for one of their love languages. Updates with new top 3 languages for user. Can be called thrice every time a user makes an update, essentially updating all three languages even if any of them remain the same for simplicity's sake.
* insert_Myers_Briggs_table: Takes inputs from user's Myers-Briggs test results. Inserts the user's code from the test results into the database.
* insert_Myers_Briggs: Takes inputs from user based off of their Myers-Briggs test results. Inserts the user's code from the test results into the database.

### makeMatchesQueries.py
Uses the scoring algorithm to properly generate the matches. Also marks pairs as matched or unmatched for use later on.
* insertScores: Inserts initial match scores into every person in the databases's matches table. This should be done as soon as the person's account is created, without the user having to recallibrate their matches manually, works given the current user's wemail.
* updateScores: If the current user updates their profile, works given the current user's wemail.
* generatePotentialMatches: Generates the matches for the current user given their wemail. Sorted by highest matching score to lowest matching score.
* generatePotentialInfo: Generates the matches and all of their information for the current user given their wemail. Sorted by highest matching score to lowest matching score.
* setMatched: Takes current user and their matched person's info and updates both of their matched status accordingly; wemail is the current user, wemail2 is the matched person.
* getMatches: Returns the information of the people the user has matched with, given the user's wemail.
* matchExists: Checks if a match exists between two people.
